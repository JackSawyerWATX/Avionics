Requirements:
1) 4 Pillars of OOP
	-Inheritance, Polymorphism (overloading or overriding), 	Encapsulation, Abstraction (Abstract class or Interface)
2) Must create and use at least 3 Constructors
3) Must have at least 4 methods
4) Use a Scanner to get responses from the user
5) Must contain a switch statement
6) Must handle at least 1 exception
7) The project must include at least 3 Classes
8) Use one of the Collections structures.
	-ArrayList, HashSet, Queue, Stack, LinkedList, HashMap (One of 	these Data Structures will count)
9) Use a loop to traverse through the Collection structure that you chose and modify, organize or return values from the iteration.

Brainstorm Ideas:

	-How can you meet the requirements? 
	-What classes you'll need to get started? 
	-What type of objects do you think you'll need to create? 
	-What are their relationships?
	-Draw out the project structure if you need a visual aid to help
	-Put comments in your classes, so you have an idea of what is going where (this will also help make sure you have all the requirements)

Plan out your Project:

Start Small:
	-Create your classes.
	-what characteristics and behavior do your objects need?
	-Don't code blindly! Have the vision and break down the logic into small pieces i.e.: don't put something that adds objects to a list in the same method as something that updates the list)
	-Consider all the yes/no questions.
